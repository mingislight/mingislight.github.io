## Service Desk: The Triage of Healthcare IT

After one year serving at the **Bozeman Health IT Service Desk**, I **appreciate being part of the triage team in Healthcare IT**:

> **The Service Desk is the first line of support that keeps patient care moving.**

Every small fix — from a VPN login to a password reset — **helps nurses and doctors focus on their patients without delay**.  
It may seem quiet and behind the scenes, but it plays a **critical role in patient care**.

## My Daily Start-of-Day Journal

1. **Start the day with the right tools ready**  
   - Open the ticketing system, email, Teams, remote tools, and verify Epic access.  
   - Test the headset — my essential tool for helping others.

2. **Begin with the right attitude: a heart to serve**  
   - Approach the day ready to support doctors, nurses, and patients with patience and respect.

3. **Stay informed on team updates and priorities**  
   - Check team messages and emails for overnight escalations, outages, or urgent triage needs.

4. **Check the Service Desk ticket queue**  
   - The queue is our daily work list.  
   - Focus fully on live calls during busy periods, and handle ticket follow-ups when call volume is light.

5. **Escalate quickly if I cannot resolve the issue**  
   - Respect the user’s time and connect them with the right team promptly.

6. **Keep learning and stay curious**  
   - Ask thoughtful questions to leaders or research solutions to grow in knowledge every day.

7. **Handle challenging conversations with grace**  
   - Stay calm and respectful, knowing frustration comes from the problem, not the person.

8. **Work with confidence, not haste**  
   - Take the time to resolve issues carefully, trusting the process and showing care in every step.

## Ticket Handling Philosophy

**Triage First, Deep Dive Second**  
- Always start with **patient care impact** as the top priority.  
- Minor issues can wait, but a blocked clinician cannot.  

**Document Clearly and Completely**  
- Every ticket tells a story: **Symptom → Actions → Resolution.**  
- Good notes protect the team and support patient safety.

**Escalate Wisely**  
- Escalation is not giving up — it is **serving the user faster** by getting the right team involved.

## Cross-Team Collaboration

The Service Desk is the **frontline of Healthcare IT**, but we are never alone.  
At Bozeman Health, we work hand-in-hand with other IT and operational teams to keep the hospital running smoothly:

- **Desktop Support Team** – Resolving on-site device, workstation, and printer issues.
- **Security Team** – Monitoring access logs, enforcing policies, and responding to suspicious activity to protect patient and staff data.
- **Epic Team** – Handling EMR access, workflows, and escalated clinical system issues.  
- **Third-Party Applications Team** – Coordinating fixes for specialized healthcare apps.  
- **PACS Team** – Supporting imaging systems that providers rely on for diagnoses.  
- **System Engineering Team** – Managing servers, networking, and backend infrastructure.  
- **Medical Record Team** – Assisting with MyChart proxy access, chart corrections, and related record requests.

Every escalation is an **opportunity to collaborate**.  
We respect the expertise of each team and work together to **solve issues quickly for clinicians and patients**.

## Teaching and Empowering Users

One of the most rewarding parts of my role is **teaching users how to use their tools confidently**.  
Healthcare moves fast, and empowering staff with the right knowledge makes a lasting difference.

I regularly help users with:

- **Windows basics** — File management, printer troubleshooting, network settings, and system updates.  
- **Epic workflows** — Navigating Hyperspace, resetting passwords, logging in remotely, and understanding charting best practices.  
- **Microsoft applications** — Training on Outlook, Teams, Excel, Word, and OneDrive for efficient communication and collaboration.  
- **Cybersecurity awareness** — Recognizing phishing attempts, managing passwords securely, and using 2FA.

> Every moment of patient care counts — so I teach with clarity, kindness, and the goal of reducing fear around technology.

My goal is always to leave the user not just with a fixed issue, but with **more confidence than before**.

## Lessons From Year One

- **The Service Desk is the heartbeat of IT.**  
  - We are the first eyes and ears for the hospital.  

- **Humility opens doors.**  
  - Small tasks and quiet work prevent big problems.  

- **Documentation is a silent partner.**  
  - Clear notes save time for teammates and future shifts.  

- **Patience is strength.**  
  - Calmness and respect make a difference in high-pressure moments.  

- **Collaboration builds trust.**  
  - Partnering with Desktop, Epic, PACS, Medical Record, Third-Party Apps, and System Engineering teams reminds me that **IT is strongest when we serve together**.

- **Ticket queue discipline matters.**  
  - Staying on top of the queue ensures nothing falls through the cracks, and focusing on live calls first keeps patient care flowing.

## Final Reflection

> *“Whoever wants to be the greatest must first be the servant of all.”*

The Service Desk is a **humble yet powerful role**.  
Every resolved ticket makes it possible for someone else to **focus on caring for patients**.  

This first year at **Bozeman Health IT** taught me three quiet strengths:  
- **Stay humble**  
- **Serve first**  
- **Keep growing each day in service and skill**

I am grateful for this foundation at Bozeman Health IT and excited to continue learning and serving in Healthcare IT.
