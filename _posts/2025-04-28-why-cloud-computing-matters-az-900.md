## 🌐 Cloud Computing: The New Foundation for Modern Work

Today, most organizations, including hospitals, schools, and businesses, rely heavily on cloud computing. 
The Cloud Service means to use the internet to access tools, storage, and services, instead of depending **only** on physical machines we own.
The three major cloud computing platforms are Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud.

The cloud offers many advantanges: flexibility, security, global access, and the ability to scale or adapt easily.  
It has become the backbone of today's workpace.

## 📚 Essential Truths from AZ-900

In my AZ-900 studies, I learned that cloud computing is based on these five clear and fundamental principles:
1. **Scalability** — the ability to handle more users or storage without the need to rebuild the whole systems.
2. **Shared Responsibility Model** — the cloud provider secures the platform, and we secure how we use it.  
3. **Availability** - Cloud keeps systems running even during failures
4. **Cost Efficiency** - "Only pay for what you use, no waste."
5. **Security Compliance** - "Built-in tools help meet strict data protection laws."

> One key lesson: Cloud Service is not about trusting blindly. It's about verifying trust and sharing responsibility wisely.

## 🏥 How Cloud Services Strengthen Bozeman Health

At Bozeman Health, cloud services are essential for our daily operations.  
We use them for communication, storage, secure sign-ins, learning, and project collaboration.
By combining our private systems with public cloud services, we build a **hybrid** cloud, balancing both **reliability** and **innovation**.

## 🛠️ Why Cloud Flexibility Matters in Healthcare

Healthcare changes fast — clinics open, emergencies happen, teams grow.  
The cloud lets us adapt quickly without waiting months for new hardware or updates.

> Flexibility is not just convenience; it’s a survival principle in healthcare and in life.

## 🔒 Security, Compliance, and Trust in the Cloud

Security is at heart of healthcare IT.  
Cloud platforms offer **encryption**, **multi-factor authentication (2FA)**, **Passwordless Sign-in Options** such as **Windows Hello**, and **data governance** to protect patients' and providers' information.

From my studies in machine learning and data science, I understand that: data must be protected at every stage — storage, transit, and usage.  
Cloud platforms allow us to do this carefully, consistently, and with modern security features that reduce risks.

## 🧑‍💻 How Cloud Supports Daily Work for Everyone

Cloud services make daily work easier and safer.  
Staff can securely access files, collaborate easily, and stay up-to-date automatically.
The cloud service companies support people quietly, allowing them to focus on what matters most.

## 💬 Lessons I See Every Day on the IT Helpdesk

On the Service Desk, cloud understanding helps me solve problems faster and more calmly.  
Many issues, including account issues, file recoveries, and application access, often trace back to the cloud systems.
So understanding the cloud identity, service health, and backup strategies is essential for me to serve better.

> In both technology and life, what truly matters happens beneath the surface.

## 🌟 Moving Forward: Learning, Serving, and Building Up

Passing AZ-900 was just the beginning.  
It showed me how cloud technology, when used wisely, can be beneficial to all healthcare organizations.
I am committed to continue this journey: growing deeper in cloud knowledge, building stronger fundations in computer science, and applying machine learning skills in daily work.

## 📝 Final Reflection

Cloud computing is about strengthening the current systems to support life, work, and care.
I am thankful to be growing at Bozeman Health.  
Step by step, let's keep on walking this walk.
