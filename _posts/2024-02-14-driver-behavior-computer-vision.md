I'm excited to share a personal milestone — my **first-author research paper** has been published in the [Journal of Big Data (Springer Open)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-024-00890-0), titled:

**"Comprehensive Study of Driver Behavior Monitoring Systems Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning Techniques"**

---

## 📖 Brief Overview

In this study, we explored how **artificial intelligence**, specifically **computer vision and deep learning**, can improve road safety.  
Our goal was to **monitor driver behavior in real time** and detect issues like **distraction or fatigue** before they become dangerous.

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

We combined several **machine learning techniques**:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** — Process video frames to recognize visual patterns.  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM, and BiLSTM** — Capture how driver behavior changes over time.  
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** — Classify behaviors into clear categories.

Together, these models could detect **eye movements, hand positions, and posture** with strong accuracy.

## 🎯 Key Findings

- Built a **real-time driver behavior monitoring system**.  
- Detected **distracted and drowsy driving** effectively.  
- Supports **advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)** and the future of **autonomous driving**.

## 🌍 Why This Research Matters

Driver behavior is a **critical factor in road safety**.  
By continuously monitoring behavior using **AI-driven computer vision**, we can:

- Reduce accidents caused by **human error**  
- Enhance **semi-autonomous vehicle safety**  
- Contribute to **smarter transportation systems**
