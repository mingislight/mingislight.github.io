I'm excited to share a personal milestone — my first-author research paper has been published in the [Journal of Big Data (Springer Open)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-024-00890-0), titled:

**"Comprehensive Study of Driver Behavior Monitoring Systems Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning Techniques"**

### 📖 **Brief Overview**
In this study, we looked at how artificial intelligence—specifically computer vision and deep learning—can be used to improve road safety. Our goal was to monitor driver behavior in real time and spot things like distraction or fatigue before they become dangerous.

### 🛠️ **Techniques Used**
We combined several powerful machine learning techniques:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: to process video frames and recognize visual patterns.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM, and BiLSTM**: to understand how driver behavior changes over time.
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: to classify behavior into specific categories.

These models worked together to detect key driver behaviors—like eye movements, hand positions, and posture—with impressive accuracy.

### 📊 **What We Found**
- We built a system that can flag risky driving behavior in real time.
- The model performed exceptionally well in recognizing distraction, drowsiness, and other common safety concerns.

### 🚗 **Why It Matters**
Driver behavior is a major factor in road safety. By using AI to monitor drivers continuously, our work takes a step toward smarter, safer vehicles—especially important for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and self-driving technologies.

### 🌟 **What It Meant to Me**
Writing this paper as first author was a growth experience. I deepened my knowledge of neural networks, especially LSTM and Transformer models, and sharpened my skills in research design and technical communication. Most of all, it reminded me how research can directly impact people’s lives.
