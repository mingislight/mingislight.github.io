## Driver Behavior Distraction — Why It Matters

Driver distraction is one of the leading causes of accidents worldwide.  
In high-risk moments, **seconds decide lives**.  
Our goal: build an AI system that spots distraction or fatigue in real time so drivers can be alerted before it’s too late.

## 3-Minute Thesis Presentation

This project was the focus of my **3-Minute Thesis presentation**, where I explained how computer vision and deep learning can detect driver distraction and drowsiness.

## Published Research

This work became my **first-author research paper** in the [Journal of Big Data (Springer Open)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-024-00890-0):

**"Comprehensive Study of Driver Behavior Monitoring Systems Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning Techniques"**

Our AI system achieved **99.1% accuracy** in detecting distraction and fatigue — a strong step toward safer roads and better driver-assistance systems.

## How the AI Works

We built a deep learning pipeline combining:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** — Identify key features in each frame, such as eye position and head angle.  
- **BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)** — Understand changes in driver behavior over time, both forward and backward in the video sequence.  
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** — Classify the driver’s state into “alert,” “distracted,” or “drowsy.”

This combination detects subtle, early signs — a gaze shift, drooping eyelids, or hands off the wheel.

## Real-World Impact

By integrating this system into vehicles, we can:

- Reduce accidents caused by human error.  
- Improve **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**.  
- Support the safety layer needed for semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles.

## Future Work — Next-Generation Driver Behavior Detection

The next step is to train **Vision Transformer (ViT)** models on **large-scale, real-world driving datasets**.  
Why this matters:

- **Greater accuracy in complex environments** — Vision Transformers excel at recognizing patterns in diverse and challenging conditions.  
- **Better generalization** — Real-life, multi-weather, multi-region datasets will help the model adapt to global driving scenarios.  
- **Integration with multi-sensor input** — Combining camera vision with radar, LiDAR, and driver biometrics can create a comprehensive safety system.

This approach could power the **next generation of Driver Behavior Detection Systems** — more adaptive, more accurate, and ready for real-world deployment.

## Personal Reflections

This research strengthened my skills in:

- Deep learning model design and optimization (CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM).  
- Presenting complex ideas clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.  
- Applying AI to practical, life-saving solutions.

It reminded me of one truth: **technology is worth building only if it protects and serves people**.
