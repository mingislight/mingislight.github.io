## Why This Matters

It is late at night. Your eyelids grow heavy and your phone buzzes. For a few seconds your attention drifts, but the car does not stop moving.  
In those moments, seconds decide lives.  

The goal of our research was simple. Build an AI assistant that sees distraction or fatigue in real time and alerts the driver before it is too late.

## From Research to Stage

This project began as my graduate research and became the focus of my **3-Minute Thesis presentation**.  
In three minutes I shared how computer vision and deep learning can detect distraction and drowsiness inside the car.

## Published in the Journal of Big Data

The research was later published in the [Journal of Big Data (Springer Open)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-024-00890-0):  

**"Comprehensive Study of Driver Behavior Monitoring Systems Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning Techniques"**

The system reached **99.1% accuracy** in detecting distraction and fatigue. It was a strong step toward safer roads.

## How It Works

Think of the AI system as two teammates working together.  

- One model watches the driver’s head position, hand position, and posture.  
- The other remember how movements change over time.  

Technically these are CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and BiLSTMs (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory).
Together they can see the quick gaze shift, hands off the wheel, or the collapsing body posture.

## The Real-World Goal

If placed in vehicles, this system could:  

- Prevent accidents caused by human error.  
- Improve **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**.  
- Add a layer of safety for semi-autonomous and autonomous driving.  

This is not surveillance of the driver. It is assistance for the road.

## Looking Ahead

The next step is training **Vision Transformers (ViT)** on large, real-world driving datasets.  
This can bring three improvements:  

- Higher accuracy in complex environments.  
- Better adaptation to weather and regional differences.  
- Stronger safety when combined with radar, LiDAR, and biometric data.

## What I Learned

This project grew my skills in:  

- Designing and tuning deep learning models.  
- Explaining complex ideas in plain language.  
- Building technology that protects people.  

The greatest lesson was this. Technology is worth building only when it serves people like a caring passenger. Yet even the best system cannot watch over us perfectly. There is One who never sleeps and never looks away. He guards our steps, and in Him we find true safety.
