We had a problem.  
Some remote computers were set up incorrectly and could no longer connect to the hospital network.  
The usual solution was heavy: ship the machines back to us, wipe them clean, put them back into the domain, and send them out again.  

That was the plan.  

But one day, by “accident,” I handled a case differently.  
Instead of waiting for the computer to be shipped back, I worked on it remotely.  
With VPN connected, I removed the computer from the domain and then rejoined it.  
And it worked.  

That made me stop and wonder: what exactly is VPN?

## What is VPN?

A VPN is like a **long invisible cable**.  
The Plug puts you back into the source, the domain where you belong.  

It lets a remote computer act as if it is sitting inside the hospital building.  

Without VPN, a computer is outside the family. It cannot see the domain, it cannot follow the rules, and it loses trust.  
With VPN, the computer comes home to its domain. It is recognized, supported, and able to work the way it was meant to.

## The Lesson

That small change of approach taught me something.  
*“Without Me you can do nothing.”*  

A computer that is away from its source forgets who it is meant to be and cannot do anything about it.  

But once it is plugged back in, it knows where it belongs.  
*“You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.”*  

The Holy Spirit is the Plug to the Source above.  
If you want the power and the life flowing, you must be connected to the Source.

  <h3>Technical Notes: Rejoining a Computer to the Domain via VPN</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Login with a <strong>local administrator account</strong> (an account that works only on that computer).</li>
    <li>Connect to the <strong>VPN</strong>.</li>
    <li>Remove the computer from the domain and put it into a temporary workgroup. Restart.</li>
    <li>Log back in with the local administrator account.</li>
    <li>Delete the old computer record from <strong>Active Directory</strong> (the system that keeps track of computers and users, stored in folders called OUs or Organizational Units).</li>
    <li>Connect to the <strong>VPN</strong> again.</li>
    <li>Rejoin the computer to the domain. Restart.</li>
    <li>Log back in with the local administrator account.</li>
    <li>Place the computer record back into the correct folder (OU) in Active Directory.</li>
    <li>Connect to the <strong>VPN</strong> if not already connected.</li>
    <li>Run <code>gpupdate /force</code> to refresh policies.</li>
    <li>Test login with a <strong>domain account</strong> (a normal user login).</li>
  </ol>
