On April 25, our Bozeman Health team held a bowling night.  
I did not win for strikes or spares, I actually got the trophy for **Most Gutter Balls**.  
It made everyone laugh, including me.  

The next morning, walking into the hospital, I was reminded again:  
It is not about us, and it is never about us. We do not just work in an office. We serve in a place where lives are saved.  
What matters most is the support we give to those who care for others.  

That night of fun with the team was more than just bowling. I have learned that:  

- A healthy team makes room for both joy and purpose.  
- Chemistry is built not only through projects but also through shared moments.  
- Being a good team member means showing up, encouraging others, and remembering that the purpose behind the work is bigger than ourselves.  

In the past, when I was starting my own company, I poured time and energy into trying to build the right team.  
I searched for people with skills and personalities that could fit together like puzzle pieces.  
My focus was on finding the perfect balance to create something of my own.  

Now, in this season, I am learning what it means to simply be a good team member.  
To serve where I am placed, to do the best within my ability, and to support those who bring healing to others.  

The Word says: *“Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.”*  

This is the heart of teamwork:  
Lift others up first and not ourselves.  
Even a small trophy for gutter balls becomes a reminder. Joy and humility go hand in hand.  

Grateful to be part of a team that makes space for both fun and purpose, where even gutter balls can teach us about grace.  
True success is not in leading our own team, but in doing every little thing faithfully where we are placed.
