## The goal: always on

Hospitals cannot go offline.  
Every minute matters for patients and staff.  
Cloud helps keep core systems running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

## What “always on” looks like

The same system runs in more than one safe location at the same time.  
If one place has a problem, traffic moves to the healthy place.  
MyChart, PACS, and the computers our doctors and nurses use stay available 24/7.

## Everyday benefits you can feel

1. Patients use MyChart day and night to check results and send messages.  
2. Imaging opens quickly because PACS stays online.  
3. Providers sign in, chart, and place orders without surprise outages.  
4. Files follow staff across devices with OneDrive, so documents are easy to find and share.  
5. Self service cuts waits because password resets, access requests, and two step sign in updates happen without a call.  
6. Staff find all their apps in one place and open the right tool fast.  
7. Accounts stay safer because users update security contacts and watch sign in activity to report anything odd.  

## What this protects

- Epic MyChart front ends and the tools providers use at the bedside.  
- Imaging and report delivery.  
- Patient portals and scheduling.  
- Secure remote access and telehealth.

## What the cloud does not fix

- Power in your building.  
- Local wired and Wi-Fi issues.  
- A single Internet circuit.

Cloud is a stronger foundation. We pair it with a well run local data center.

## How the cloud reduces downtime

- Two or more locations run the same service.  
- If one fails, the system switches over automatically.  
- Updates happen in small steps so care does not stop.  
- Extra capacity appears during traffic peaks.  
- Backups run in the background, and restorations are fast when needed.

## A simple hospital setup that works

- App servers in more than one location (public cloud + local).  
- Databases with high availability and quick failover.  
- Backups in a second region and regular restoration tests.  
- Private connections from sites to cloud with at least two paths.  
- Central monitoring and alerts that reach on-call staff.

## Why this matters

Less downtime means fewer delays in our services.  
Patients get care faster.  
That is the win.

> “By love serve one another.”

I study cloud service to serve better in healthcare IT.  
If one person is helped and a patient is cared for faster, it is worth it.  
Serve with Knowledge, for one another.
