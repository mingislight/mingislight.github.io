## The goal of Cloud Services: Always On

Hospitals cannot go offline.  
Every minute matters for patients and staff.  
Cloud keeps core systems running around the clock.

## What “Always On” means

Cloud runs the same system in more than one safe place.  
If one location has trouble, traffic shifts to the healthy one.  
That keeps MyChart, PACS, and provider workstations available 24/7.

## Everyday benefits

1. Patients use MyChart any time to check results and send messages.  
2. Imaging opens quickly because PACS is always online.  
3. Providers log in, chart, and order without sudden outages.  
4. Files follow staff across devices with OneDrive for easy access.  
5. Self service shortens waits for password resets and access requests.  
6. All apps are in one place so staff can work efficiently.  
7. Accounts stay safer when users update contacts and track sign-in activity.  

## What this protects

- MyChart and Epic tools used at the bedside.  
- Imaging viewers and report delivery.  
- Patient portals and scheduling.  
- Secure telehealth and remote access.

## What the cloud does not cover

- Power in the building.  
- Local wired and Wi-Fi problems.  
- A single Internet circuit.

That is why we pair cloud with a well run local data center.

## How downtime is reduced

- Services run in two or more locations.  
- If one fails, the system switches automatically.  
- Updates roll out in small steps so care does not stop.  
- Extra capacity appears during traffic peaks.  
- Backups run in the background with fast restore options.

## A working hospital setup

- App servers in both public cloud and local data centers.  
- Databases with high availability and quick failover.  
- Backups stored in a second region and tested often.  
- Private connections to the cloud with at least two paths.  
- Central monitoring and alerts that reach on-call staff.

## Why it matters

Less downtime means fewer delays.  
Patients receive care faster.  
That is the win.

> “By love serve one another.”

I study cloud service to serve better in healthcare IT.  
If one person is helped and a patient is cared for faster, it is worth it.  
Serve with Knowledge, for one another.
