## About

Hi, I’m Ming.  
Welcome to mingislight.com.

I work in Healthcare IT. 
My work helps patient care run smoothly. 
I support Epic Healthy Planet care management.  
I use analytics to focus on what matters most for patient care.  
I look for missing data that slows teams down.

I am also growing as a computer scientist.  
I study machine learning in practical ways.  
I use it to reduce errors and improve everyday work. 

Earlier in my career, I worked directly with the elderly.  
They reminded me of my grandparents.  
That time shaped how I think about patience and responsibility in care.

This site is where I share what I am learning and building.  
I move one project at a time.  
I share real work and real mistakes.
I trust the right person will find this at the right time.
